# Spotahome exercise app
A spotahome exercise

This my provided solution to the exercise. I included a __run.sh__ script to easily deploy it using docker. This script is located at __$ProjectPath/docker/run.sh__.

I provided a simple (and quite useless test) to test de use case. I just did this to show I use TDD, but in a real scenario this use case (and most of use cases based on query) are usually tested from outside (with curl, from a restlet client, etc).
